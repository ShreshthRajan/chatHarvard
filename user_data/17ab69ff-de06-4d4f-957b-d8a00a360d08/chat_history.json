I'll still provide you with information about it in case you're inquiring for someone else or need a refresher.\n\n## Course Overview\nMATH 121 is a second course in linear algebra that focuses on understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and developing skills in reading and writing mathematical proofs. The course covers:\n- Real and complex vector spaces\n- Linear transformations\n- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\n## Ratings and Structure\n- **Overall Course Rating**: 4.3/5.0 (which is quite good)\n- **Instructor**: John Cain (for Spring 2026)\n\n## Student Feedback\nStudents have described MATH 121 as:\n- \"Very open/exploratory\" with an instructor who \"REALLY cares about his students\"\n- A course where students learned about their \"relationship with math and learning\"\n- Having a \"looser structure\" that requires self-accountability\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Anti-requisite**: This course should not be taken in addition to Mathematics 22a, 23a, 25a, or 55a.\n- A student specifically recommended: \"Take Math 121 :)\"\n- Another student advised: \"Be sure to hold yourself accountable\" due to the course's looser structure\n\n## Personal Consideration\nSince you've already completed MATH 121, you might want to consider more advanced mathematics courses that build upon the linear algebra foundation. If you were asking about something specific related to MATH 121 (possibly related to \"car\" in your query), could you please clarify your question?", "courseData": {"embedding": null, "edited_at": "2025-04-09 16:56:05.997332+00", "course_id": 120228, "class_name": "Linear Algebra", "class_tag": "MATH 121", "instructors": "[\"John Cain\"]", "term": "2026 Spring", "session": "Full Term", "start_date": null, "end_date": null, "room": null, "addr": null, "days": "[\"M\",\"W\"]", "class_number": 13082, "consent": "No Consent", "enrolled": null, "description": "This is a second course in linear algebra, with an emphasis on understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and learning to read and write proofs.

I walked away from the class learning more about my relationship with math and learning. The class could have been better with more structure but it was what I needed for the semester. It is a very easy going course\",\"Take Math 121 :)\",\"If you take this course, be sure to hold yourself accountable. Because of its looser structure, it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind.\",\"This class is what you make of it \u2013 you can do as much or as little as you like to get by. If you do wish to do more, it's certainly possible and can be a great mathematics course in this regard, especially with experience writing proofs.\",\"This is a great intro to proofs! The topics are interesting, but I strongly recommend taking Math 21b beforehand.\",\"This is a very difficult class that is very chill if you want it to be. ONLY take this class if you really want to learn math AND are VERY self\u2013guided.\",\"With Dylan Wilson, there is opportunity to explore if you have the time and motivation. There are no grades, which means that you have to be *really* self\u2013driven to make the class what you want. I did not, and so I feel like I did not get much out of the class. I will be self\u2013studying MIT's 18.06 Linear Algebra class to make up for my lack of foundational linear alg knowledge.\\n\\nWhen I tried to pset with peers, many politely declined because they valued the class as lower relative to their other classes. Thus, the lack of grading in this class RELATIVE to other classes means that there was a lack of community through struggle (lol). I wish I got to know my peers better!! They seemed like cool people.\",\"This class is much more proof\u2013based than something like Math 21b, and I would recommend having 21b under your belt beforehand, because without it, material in proof format can seem much more confusing. Dylan was great and super helpful, though not sure what this class under another professor would be like.\",\"If you have any interest in upper level mathematics, you should take this class. It will give you all the necessary tools you need to pursue anything else you would choose to in the department.\",\"If Dylan Wilson is teaching this class \u2013 take it. Best professor I've had in terms of actually prioritizing learning over completionism. The course material is still a little dry \u2013 it's proof\u2013based linear algebra, but Dylan makes up for it.\",\"Dylan is an AMAZING professor. I have never felt safe in a math classroom to inquire and genuinely learn until I took Dylan's class/had him as a professor. He really emphasizes learning to learn instead of for an output (grade). He is also great at explaining difficult concepts, and some things I didn't understand in 21b suddenly clicked in 121. Be wary of who is teaching this though\u2013\u2013experience is highly dependent on the instructor.\",\"This class has a ton of flexibility. If you can manage things on your own without outside structure, then take this class! Dylan is super nice and puts an emphasis on learning purely for learning's sake. If you're not great with a lot of flexibility and need external structure, don't take this. It's very self guided, so you won't be able to learn just with what's given.\",\"Take this class; it will definitely expand your understanding in general beyond math.\",\"It is probably not worth your time.\",\"Great class\"]"}}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I need to take a 130s level math class in the fall for my concentration requirements. first check if thats needed, then tell me all the fall options and what's easiest (by hours needed)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Mathematics Concentration Requirements\n\n## Concentration Requirement Assessment\n\nBased on your student profile, you're concentrating in Mathematics and have already taken MATH 121 (Linear Algebra). The Mathematics concentration does require students to take courses in the 130s level to complete their degree. Specifically, you need to take at least one course numbered between 130-136 or 131-136 (depending on your specific track within the Mathematics concentration).\n\n## Fall 2025 Options for 130s-Level Courses\n\nLooking at the available courses for Fall 2025, you have these 130s-level options:\n\n1. **MATH 131: Topological Spaces and Fundamental Group** (Instructor: Michael Hopkins)\n   - Workload: **10.8 hours/week** (highest workload of available options)\n   - Rating: 4.52/5.0 (excellent rating)\n   - Content: Covers abstract topological spaces and algebraic topology\n   - Student comment: \"Auroux is a great lecturer\" (note: your instructor would be Hopkins)\n\n2. **MATH 136: Differential Geometry** (Instructor: Oliver Knill)\n   - Workload: **6.1 hours/week** (lowest workload of available options)\n   - Rating: 4.13/5.0 (good rating)\n   - Content: Introduction to Riemannian geometry focusing on curves and surfaces\n   - Student comment: \"This class is a lot of fun and a good class to fulfill the 130s requirement\"\n\n## Easiest Option by Workload\n\n**MATH 136** is clearly your best option if you're prioritizing a lighter workload. At 6.1 hours per week, it requires significantly less time than MATH 131 (10.8 hours/week). That's a difference of nearly 5 hours per week, which can be substantial over a semester.\n\nThe course also has a good Q score of 4.25, indicating students generally have a positive experience with the material and instruction. Students have commented that it's \"enjoyable, accessible, and is a fun new way to think about math.\"\n\n## Alternative Options (Not Available in Fall 2025)\n\nFor reference, other 130s options typically offered in Spring include:\n\n- **MATH 130: Classical Geometry** (10.3 hours/week)\n- **MATH 132: Differential Topology** (10.1 hours/week)\n- **MATH 137: Algebraic Geometry** (10.0 hours/week)\n\n## Recommendation\n\nI strongly recommend **MATH 136: Differential Geometry** for Fall 2025 based on your workload concerns. It requires the least amount of time commitment (6.1 hours/week) while still fulfilling your concentration requirement and maintaining a good quality rating.\n\nIf you're interested in topology and have extra time to dedicate to coursework, MATH 131 is also an excellent course with very high ratings, though be prepared for a heavier workload."}]
