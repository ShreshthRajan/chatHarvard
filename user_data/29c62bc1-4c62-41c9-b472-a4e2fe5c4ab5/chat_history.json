Nevertheless, here's the course information you requested:\n\n## Course Details\n- **Instructor:** John Cain (for Spring 2026)\n- **Term:** Spring 2026\n- **Overall Rating:** 4.3/5.0 (which is quite good)\n- **Workload:** No specific hour data available\n\n## Course Description\nThis is a second course in linear algebra that emphasizes understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and focuses on developing proof-reading and proof-writing skills. The course covers:\n- Real and complex vector spaces\n- Linear transformations\n- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\n## Requirements\nAnti-requisite: Not to be taken in addition to Mathematics 22a, 23a, 25a, or 55a.\n\n## Student Feedback\nStudents have generally positive things to say about the course:\n- \"Very open/exploratory course. You can tell that the instructor REALLY cares about students.\"\n- \"Take Math 121 :)\"\n- Some students noted the course has a looser structure, recommending: \"Be sure to hold yourself accountable... it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind.\"\n\n## Note\nSince you've already taken MATH 121 according to your profile, you might want to look into advanced courses that build upon this foundation. Is there something specific about MATH 121 you were trying to find out, or perhaps you're interested in related follow-up courses?", "courseData": {"embedding": null, "edited_at": "2025-04-09 16:56:05.997332+00", "course_id": 120228, "class_name": "Linear Algebra", "class_tag": "MATH 121", "instructors": "[\"John Cain\"]", "term": "2026 Spring", "session": "Full Term", "start_date": null, "end_date": null, "room": null, "addr": null, "days": "[\"M\",\"W\"]", "class_number": 13082, "consent": "No Consent", "enrolled": null, "description": "This is a second course in linear algebra, with an emphasis on understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and learning to read and write proofs.
