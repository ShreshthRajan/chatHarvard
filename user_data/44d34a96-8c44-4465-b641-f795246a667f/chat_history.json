Based on your academic profile as an Applied Computation concentrator with background in CS, Math, Philosophy, and Economics, I've identified some potentially interesting options from the available fall courses.\n\n## Recommendations Based on Your Background\n\n### 1. **PHIL 4 - Logic I** (Fall 2024)\n- **Rating:** 4.37/5.0 (Strong reviews)\n- **Instructor:** Bernhard Nickel\n- **Connection to your profile:** You've taken PHIL 142, and this course could strengthen your logical reasoning skills, which complement your computational focus.\n- **Student feedback:** \"Overall, this is a great and interesting class! Professor Nickel was awesome and gave interesting lectures.\"\n- **Note:** Given your experience with CS courses, you might find interesting connections between logic and computational theory.\n\n### 2. **PHIL 138 - Heidegger's Being and Time** (Fall 2024)\n- **Rating:** 4.73/5.0 (Excellent reviews)\n- **Connection to your profile:** Building on your previous philosophy course (PHIL 142)\n- **Description:** A close reading of Martin Heidegger's Being and Time, covering topics like the intelligibility of the world we inhabit.\n\n### 3. **PHIL 185 - Philosophy and Architecture** (Fall 2025)\n- **Rating:** 4.25/5.0 (Very good reviews)\n- **Instructor:** Remei Capdevila Werning\n- **Student feedback:** \"If you're remotely interested in architecture or design, you should take this course! I had a great experience, and learned a lot.\"\n- **Note:** This is scheduled for Fall 2025, not the upcoming fall term.\n\n## Courses Related to Your Concentration\n\nWhile not directly in your concentration, some courses that might connect to applied computation include:\n\n- **BIOPHYS 3001QC - Research Design and Proposal Writing** (Quarter Course)\n  - Could be valuable for developing research skills if you're considering graduate-level work in computational applications\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. I notice the course information doesn't include detailed workload data for most courses, so I can't provide specific time commitment estimates.\n\n2. None of the courses retrieved are directly in your Applied Computation concentration. Would you like me to search for more specific courses in CS, data science, or other areas related to applied computation?\n\n3. Some courses listed (like PHIL 185) are actually for Fall 2025, not the upcoming term.\n\n## Would You Like More Specific Recommendations?\n\nI can provide more targeted recommendations if you could specify:\n- Are you looking for courses in a particular subject area?\n- Do you prefer courses with light, moderate, or heavy workloads?\n- Are you looking for courses to fulfill specific concentration requirements?\n- What year are you in your studies?\n\nLet me know if you'd like more specific guidance, and I'd be happy to help!"}]
