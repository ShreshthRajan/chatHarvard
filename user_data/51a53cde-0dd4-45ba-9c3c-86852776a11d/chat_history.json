This is a standard requirement for the Mathematics concentration at Harvard. Since you've already taken MATH 121 (Linear Algebra), a 130s course would be an appropriate next step in your concentration pathway.\n\n## Fall 2025 Options for 130s Level Math Courses\n\nBased on the information provided, you have one primary 130s-level course available in Fall 2025:\n\n### MATH 136 - Differential Geometry (Recommended)\n- **Instructor:** Oliver Knill\n- **Overall Rating:** 4.13/5.0 (Well-rated)\n- **Mean Hours per Week:** 6.1 hours (Lowest workload among 130s courses)\n- **Description:** Introduction to Riemannian geometry focusing on curves and surfaces in space where the fundamental notions can be visualized.\n- **Student Comments:** \"This class is a lot of fun and a good class to fulfill the 130s requirement in the Math concentration! It is enjoyable, accessible, and is a fun new way to think about math.\"\n\nThis is clearly your best option if workload is your priority. At 6.1 hours per week, MATH 136 requires significantly less time than other 130s courses, which typically require 10+ hours weekly.\n\n## Other Fall 2025 Math Courses\n\nIf you're open to alternatives, there's also:\n\n### MATH 131 - Topological Spaces and Fundamental Group\n- **Instructor:** Michael Hopkins\n- **Overall Rating:** 4.52/5.0 (Higher than MATH 136)\n- **Mean Hours per Week:** 10.8 hours (Almost double the workload of MATH 136)\n- **Description:** Introduction to abstract topological spaces and algebraic topology including homotopy theory, fundamental groups and covering spaces.\n- **Student Comments:** Varies from \"Auroux is a great lecturer\" to \"This class is hard... stay far away [unless you're concentrating in math].\"\n\n### Lower-Level Options (Not 130s Level)\n\nIf you're considering lower-level options for the fall semester:\n\n1. **MATH 19A - Modeling and Differential Equations for Life Sciences**\n   - **Rating:** 4.55/5.0\n   - No workload data available\n   - More applied focus toward life sciences\n\n2. **MATH 18A - Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences**\n   - **Rating:** 4.43/5.0\n   - No workload data available\n   - Note: Anti-requisite for MATH 21a, so you cannot take both\n\n## Workload Comparison of 130s Courses\n\nHere's how the 130s courses compare by workload:\n\n| Course | Mean Hours | Q Score |\n|--------|------------|---------|\n| MATH 136 | 6.1 | 4.25 |\n| MATH 137 | 10.0 | 4.28 |\n| MATH 132 | 10.1 | 4.18 |\n| MATH 130 | 10.3 | 2.00 |\n| MATH 131 | 10.8 | 4.56 |\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**MATH 136 (Differential Geometry)** is clearly your best option if you're prioritizing a lighter workload while fulfilling your 130s requirement. With only 6.1 hours per week (compared to 10+ hours for other options), and a solid Q score of 4.25, it offers the best balance of quality and manageable time commitment.\n\nIf you're more concerned with course ratings than workload, MATH 131 has the highest rating (4.56), but requires nearly double the weekly time commitment at 10.8 hours.\n\nWould you like more specific information about any of these courses?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "math 121 course card"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# MATH 121 - Linear Algebra\n\nI notice that you're asking for the course card for MATH 121, but according to your student profile, you've already taken this course.
