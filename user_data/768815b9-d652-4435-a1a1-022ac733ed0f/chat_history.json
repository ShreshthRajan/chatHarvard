However, I'm happy to provide you with the course details that might be helpful for future reference or for advising peers.\n\n## Course Overview\n- **Instructor:** John Cain (for Spring 2026)\n- **Term:** Spring 2026\n- **Mean Hours per Week:** 8.0 (moderate workload)\n- **Overall Course Rating:** 4.3/5.0 (very good rating)\n\n## Description\nMATH 121 is a second course in linear algebra that emphasizes understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and focuses on developing proof-writing skills. The course covers:\n- Real and complex vector spaces\n- Linear transformations\n- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n\n## Requirements\n**Anti-requisite:** This course should not be taken if you've already completed Mathematics 22a, 23a, 25a, or 55a.\n\n## Student Feedback\nStudents have noted that MATH 121 is:\n- \"Very open/exploratory\" with an instructor who \"REALLY cares about his students\"\n- A course where you can learn about \"relationship with math and learning\"\n- One that might benefit from \"more structure\" but is generally \"easy going\"\n- A course where self-accountability is important: \"Because of its looser structure, it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind\"\n\nSince you've already taken MATH 121 as part of your Mathematics concentration, this information might be useful for reflecting on your experience or advising fellow students. If you're looking for information about a different course or have questions about advanced mathematics courses to continue your studies, please let me know!"}]
