You can tell that Dylan REALLY cares about his students. I walked away from the class learning more about my relationship with math and learning. The class could have been better with more structure but it was what I needed for the semester. It is a very easy going course\"\n- \"Take Math 121 :)\"\n- \"If you take this course, be sure to hold yourself accountable. Because of its looser structure, it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind.\"\n\n**Note:** Even though this course is beyond the scope of your concentration in Akkadian, you've already taken this course, as noted in your student profile.
