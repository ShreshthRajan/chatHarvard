Since you're concentrating in Afrikaans but have only taken MATH 121 so far, these recommendations could help diversify your academic experience.\n\n## Top Recommendations\n\n### 1. PHYSICS 191 - Advanced Laboratory (Spring 2026)\n**Overall Rating: 4.8/5.0**\n\nThis is one of the highest-rated courses in the recommendations. While it's a physics course, the skills developed are transferable to many disciplines:\n\n- You'll complete three different experimental projects in various physics fields\n- The course emphasizes scientific writing skills that are valuable across academia\n- Students consistently praise the course, with one noting it was \"definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard\"\n- The hands-on nature helps you understand theoretical concepts in practical ways\n\n### 2. SOC-STD 50 - Foundations of Social Science Research (Spring 2026)\n**Overall Rating: 4.73/5.0**\n\nThis might be particularly valuable for broadening your research skills:\n\n- Introduces a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research methods\n- Covers interviews, focus groups, archives, ethnographic observation, and more\n- Student comments highlight its value: \"Matt knows everything there is to know under the sun about the science of research\"\n- The skills learned would complement your Afrikaans concentration with research methodology\n\n### 3. SOCIOL 1157 - Qualitative Methods in Sociology (Spring 2025)\n**Overall Rating: 4.67/5.0**\n\nThis course offers practical research skills:\n\n- Focuses on interviews, ethnography, and archival content analysis\n- Includes hands-on exercises and fieldwork opportunities\n- Students recommend it especially \"if you want to write a thesis\"\n- The weekly applications of methods would provide concrete skills\n\n## Alternative Options\n\nIf you're interested in more quantitative approaches:\n\n### STAT 210 - Probability I (Fall 2025)\n**Overall Rating: 4.59/5.0**\n\nTaught by Joseph Blitzstein, this course builds on concepts that might connect to your MATH 121 background. Students note it \"represents a weird middle ground between the math required to understand advanced statistics and the intuitions of advanced statistics.\"\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. **Prerequisites**: Some courses like BIOSTAT 232 have specific prerequisites you likely haven't met yet.\n\n2. **Concentration Requirements**: None of these courses directly fulfill your Afrikaans concentration requirements, so you should consider them as complementary to your core studies.\n\n3. **Course Level**: Consider whether you're prepared for advanced courses. For example, STAT 210 students mention it helps to have \"higher level math prep to fully appreciate the material.\"\n\n4. **Timing**: These courses are spread across different terms (Fall 2024 through Spring 2026), so you'll need to plan accordingly.\n\nWould you like more specific recommendations related to your Afrikaans concentration, or would you prefer I focus on a particular subject area or skill set you're interested in developing?"}]
