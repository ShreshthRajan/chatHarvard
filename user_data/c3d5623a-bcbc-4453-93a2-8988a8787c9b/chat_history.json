Nevertheless, here's the information about the course:\n\n## Course Details\n- **Instructor:** John Cain\n- **Term:** 2026 Spring\n- **Overall Rating:** 4.3/5.0 (which is quite good)\n- **Mean Hours per Week:** Not available in the data provided\n\n## Course Description\nThis is a second course in linear algebra, with an emphasis on understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and learning to read and write proofs. Topics include real and complex vector spaces, linear transformations, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\n## Requirements\nAnti-requisite: Not to be taken in addition to Mathematics 22a, 23a, 25a, or 55a.\n\n## Student Feedback\n- \"Very open/exploratory course. You can tell that Dylan REALLY cares about his students. I walked away from the class learning more about my relationship with math and learning. The class could have been better with more structure but it was what I needed for the semester. It is a very easy going course.\"\n- \"Take Math 121 :)\"\n- \"If you take this course, be sure to hold yourself accountable. Because of its looser structure, it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind.\"\n\n## Note\nSince you've already taken MATH 121 according to your academic record, you might want to consider more advanced mathematics courses if you're looking for additional math credits. As a Mathematics concentrator, you might want to explore other upper-level courses that build on the linear algebra foundation you've established.\n\nIs there a specific reason you're asking about a course you've already taken, or would you like information about other mathematics courses?", "courseData": {"embedding": null, "edited_at": "2025-04-09 16:56:05.997332+00", "course_id": 120228, "class_name": "Linear Algebra", "class_tag": "MATH 121", "instructors": "[\"John Cain\"]", "term": "2026 Spring", "session": "Full Term", "start_date": null, "end_date": null, "room": null, "addr": null, "days": "[\"M\",\"W\"]", "class_number": 13082, "consent": "No Consent", "enrolled": null, "description": "This is a second course in linear algebra, with an emphasis on understanding linear algebra at a more abstract level and learning to read and write proofs.
