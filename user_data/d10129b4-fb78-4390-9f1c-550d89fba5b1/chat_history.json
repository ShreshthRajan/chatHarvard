[{"role": "user", "content": "ds"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since your query \"ds\" is quite broad and unclear, I'll assume you might be referring to something related to \"Data Science\" courses, a common abbreviation for which is \"DS.\" However, please note that without a specific department or course level mentioned, it's challenging to provide very targeted recommendations. If \"Data Science\" isn't what you meant, feel free to clarify your query for more precise advice.\n\nGiven the potential interest in data science and considering the context of Harvard's diverse course offerings, here are a couple of foundational courses that might align with an introductory interest in data science, analytics, or related areas:\n\n1. **Stat 104: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics**\n   - **Description**: This course provides an introduction to statistical methods and their applications, suitable for analyzing and making sense of data, which might be of interest if you're looking towards data science.\n   - **Term**: Typically offered both in Fall and Spring.\n   - **Workload and Ratings**: Details might not be available, but introductory statistics courses tend to have a moderate workload.\n\n2. **CS 50: Introduction to Computer Science**\n   - **Description**: Although primarily a computer science course, CS50 covers foundational skills in computer science and programming which are essential for data science.\n   - **Term**: Offered annually.\n   - **Workload and Ratings**: Known for being intense but highly educational, with comprehensive support structures in place.\n\nGiven your background in Amharic and a course you've taken in mathematics (MATH 121), these courses can provide a supportive backdrop as you delve into areas that involve both computational and analytical skills, which are crucial in data science.\n\nIf you had something else in mind with \"ds,\" such as a particular domain within your current concentration or a different subject entirely, please let me know so I can provide more targeted suggestions."}]
