Professor Porter is amazing\" and \"definitely been my favorite\" Government class for some students.\n- **Notes:** The class includes both undergraduates and graduate students, but undergrads report being able to thrive in this environment.\n\n### GOV 1280 - Government & Politics of China\n- **Instructor:** Yuhua Wang\n- **Rating:** Excellent (4.75/5.0)\n- **Benefits:** Would add comparative politics depth to your concentration with focus on a major world power.\n- **Student Feedback:** \"Professor Wang is fantastic\" and \"an amazing course\" that provides great historical context.\n- **Notes:** Described as accessible even for non-concentrators, with \"chill\" assignments.\n\n### GOV 1796 - Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press\n- **Rating:** Perfect (5.0/5.0)\n- **Benefits:** Combines American politics with international relations through case studies and strategic analysis.\n- **Student Feedback:** \"Incredible course, take it if you get the opportunity\" and \"the best that I've taken at Harvard.\"\n- **Notes:** This is a rigorous and time-intensive course that requires application and instructor consent.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n1. **GOV 30 (American Government)** appears in the recommendations but I notice you've already taken this course, so you should disregard this option.\n\n2. **Upper-level seminars** like GOV 94AU (Political Economy with Torben Iversen) might be worth considering to further specialize within your concentration.\n\n3. **Research opportunities** are available through GOV 3000A if you're interested in working with a specific professor on an independent project.\n\nWould you like more specific information about any of these courses or how they relate to particular Government concentration requirements?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "list allo f the governement courses for fall 2025"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Government Courses for Fall 2025\n\nI notice you're asking about Government courses for Fall 2025. Based on the information available to me, I don't have access to the course listings for Fall 2025 at this time. \n\n## Why This Information Isn't Available\n\nCourse catalogs for future academic terms like Fall 2025 typically aren't published this far in advance. Harvard usually releases course listings for upcoming semesters much closer to the registration period:\n\n- Fall semester courses are usually published in the late spring/early summer\n- Spring semester courses are usually published in the late fall\n\n## What You Can Do Instead\n\n1. **Check Current Offerings**: You can review recent fall semester Government course offerings to get a sense of what might be available. Many Government courses are offered on a regular rotation.\n\n2. **Contact the Government Department**: The department administrators might have preliminary information about planned courses, especially for core requirements.\n\n3. **Review the Course Catalog**: The official Harvard course catalog can give you an overview of all Government courses that exist, though it won't specify which will be offered in Fall 2025.\n\n4. **Speak with Your Concentration Advisor**: They can help you plan ahead based on typical course rotations and your specific concentration requirements.\n\nGiven your progress in the Government concentration (having taken GOV 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 51, 97, and several upper-level courses), you appear to have completed many of the core requirements already. When Fall 2025 approaches, you'll likely be looking at upper-level electives and seminars to complete your concentration.\n\nWould you like information about Government courses from a more recent term instead, or help planning your remaining concentration requirements?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Math fall course offerings. list all of them"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Mathematics Fall Course Offerings\n\nBased on the available information, here are the mathematics courses offered for Fall 2025/2024:\n\n## Introductory Level Courses\n\n- **MATH 55A - Studies in Algebra and Group Theory**\n  - Instructor: Denis Auroux\n  - Description: A rigorous introduction to abstract algebra and group theory\n  - Notes: This is an intensive course that prepares students for Math 123 and other advanced courses\n\n- **MATH 101 - Sets, Groups, and Real Analysis**\n  - Instructor: Janet Chen\n  - Rating: 4.56/5.0\n  - Description: Introduction to abstract mathematical thought and proof techniques\n\n## Graduate & Advanced Undergraduate Courses\n\n- **MATH 223AR - Algebraic Number Theory**\n  - Instructor: Melanie Wood\n  - Rating: 4.83/5.0\n  - Description: Graduate introduction covering ideal class groups, zeta functions, and local class field theory\n\n- **MATH 242 - Mathematical Biology-Evolutionary Dynamics**\n  - Instructor: Martin Nowak\n  - Description: Covers concepts like reproduction, selection, mutation, game dynamics, and evolution\n\n## Specialized Topics Courses\n\n- **MATH 254Z - Applications of Khovanov homology in low-dimensional topology**\n  - Instructor: Gage Martin\n\n- **MATH 257Z - Parabolic equations and their applications**\n  - Instructor: Kevin Yang\n  - Prerequisites: Math 114 or Math 212 (familiarity with Lebesgue integration, Banach spaces)\n\n- **MATH 261 - Algebraic vector bundles and motivic homotopy theory**\n  - Instructor: Michael Hopkins\n  - Rating: 5.0/5.0\n\n- **MATH 265 - Singularities and Hodge theory**\n  - Instructor: Mihnea Popa\n  - Rating: 4.75/5.0\n  - Student comment: \"An amazing topics class\" with \"wonderfully prepared lecture notes\"\n\n- **MATH 266 - Motivic homotopy theory**\n  - Instructor: Thomas Brazelton\n  - Rating: 5.0/5.0\n  - Student comment: \"Great\" and \"Phenomenal lecturer\"\n\n- **MATH 267Z - Posets**\n  - Instructor: Colin Defant\n  - Rating: 4.55/5.0\n  - Description: Covers partially ordered sets in algebraic combinatorics\n  - Student comments note the course is \"chill\" with only 3 problem sets and a final project\n\nI notice you're a Government concentrator. If you're considering taking a mathematics course, MATH 101 might be the most accessible option if you don't have extensive mathematics background. If you're interested in applications to social sciences, MATH 242 (Mathematical Biology-Evolutionary Dynamics) could have some relevant game theory concepts.\n\nWould you like more specific information about any of these courses?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So math 21 is not offered in fall 2025?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# MATH 21 Availability for Fall 2025\n\nBased on the course information available, it appears that **MATH 21A (Multivariable Calculus) is not scheduled to be offered in Fall 2025**.\n\nAccording to the data I have access to, MATH 21A is currently scheduled for Spring 2026, not Fall 2025.

It\u2019s important since there\u2019s not lecture notes posted just example problems solutions, so it\u2019s difficult to catch up if you miss class or are not paying attention. Exams are often variable in difficulty so be prepared!\",\"A good amount of work, but totally doable! Study in advance for tests.\",\"Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to class time (three sections + workshop) in addition to three psets per week! That being said if you are interested in math or have to take this for a requirement it's a great option! Super well taught and well organized.\",\"Do not take this course unless you've taken multivariable calculus before.\",\"This course was not too difficult, it's well\u2013structured and taught in a manner that makes sense, with each new concept building smoothly off the previous one. The content is presented in a way that doesn't make it too hard to digest, but sometimes, the lectures could be a bit repetitive and we wouldn't be able to really understand the new concept presented (at least for my section). The problem sets are manageable although it is slightly annoying that there are three per week, but in retrospect, it is nice that the problems are spread out over the week so that it forces you to apply the new concept right after you have learned it. Some of the problems are a bit brain\u2013numbing and can take so time, but the lecture does a good job of giving you the necessary tools needed to solve the problem.\\n\\nOriginally, I was deciding between Math 22a and Math 21a, and I am happy with my decision. However, if you enjoy proofs, I would say go with Math 22. Otherwise, Math 21a is also a great option and gives a lot of practical knowledge.\",\"This course is very interesting. Please dedicate enough time to it so that you can process what you're learning and gain deep understanding.\",\"This course is great, highly recommend. The pace is good. While 3 psets a week might seem like a lot, it helped me understand everything and not be overwhelmed when exams rolld around.\",\"If you don't have to take this class, don't take it. The Psets are entirely too long, and 3 Psets a week has never been reasonable. Also, if the course head is Philip Wood, be prepared for very unfair exams that will likely not be curved.\",\"Math 21a is a well taught multivariable calculus class, that teaches you everything you need to know in small sections, giving you the chance to work on problems in class with your peers and ask questions to your TF and CAs. The content builds on itself really well and the applications of the content is made pretty clear, that helps with intuitive understanding. Consider if your academic plans require knowledge of proof\u2013based math, because then I would encourage other options.\",\"This class is definitely very time consuming with the 3 PSETs a week. Compared to 1B, this isn't as intuitive and was a lot more difficult due to having to visualize things in 3D, and also vectors was pretty difficult. There's only 1 PSET drop with no retakes for the exams except the mini\u2013exam, which isnt really worth much. The first exam felt pretty reasonable content wise but the grading was strict with losing a bunch of points for getting a true/false question wrong so make sure you understand things conceptually. The second exam though was nothing like the practice exams with a lot of the questions not focusing on the main ideas we were focusing on in that unit.\",\"Be prepared for everything that will come your way. The three psets a week add up. You will always find yourself doing psets and in that process, exams sneak up on you. Take this course if you can manage these things.\",\"Yes.\",\"Keep up with the work. Beware of the exams. The exams were particularly bad for us this semester, but the course head is going to change. But err on the side of caution and study especially hard for the exams. It can be a bit easy to do the weekly Pset and leave it at that without digesting what you're learning week\u2013to\u2013week. Make sure you give yourself time to build those skills before the exam. Don't be super scared of this course. It takes some time, but it's not a course with a lot of unreasonable demands like other courses here.\",\"not bad just know calc and use mqc\"]"}}]
