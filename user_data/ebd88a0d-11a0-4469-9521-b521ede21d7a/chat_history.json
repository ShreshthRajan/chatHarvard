I walked away from the class learning more about my relationship with math and learning. The class could have been better with more structure but it was what I needed for the semester. It is a very easy going course\",\"Take Math 121 :)\",\"If you take this course, be sure to hold yourself accountable. Because of its looser structure, it is easy to allow yourself to fall a bit behind.\",\"This class is what you make of it \u2013 you can do as much or as little as you like to get by. If you do wish to do more, it's certainly possible and can be a great mathematics course in this regard, especially with experience writing proofs.\",\"This is a great intro to proofs! The topics are interesting, but I strongly recommend taking Math 21b beforehand.\",\"This is a very difficult class that is very chill if you want it to be. ONLY take this class if you really want to learn math AND are VERY self\u2013guided.\",\"With Dylan Wilson, there is opportunity to explore if you have the time and motivation. There are no grades, which means that you have to be *really* self\u2013driven to make the class what you want. I did not, and so I feel like I did not get much out of the class. I will be self\u2013studying MIT's 18.06 Linear Algebra class to make up for my lack of foundational linear alg knowledge.\\n\\nWhen I tried to pset with peers, many politely declined because they valued the class as lower relative to their other classes. Thus, the lack of grading in this class RELATIVE to other classes means that there was a lack of community through struggle (lol). I wish I got to know my peers better!! They seemed like cool people.\",\"This class is much more proof\u2013based than something like Math 21b, and I would recommend having 21b under your belt beforehand, because without it, material in proof format can seem much more confusing. Dylan was great and super helpful, though not sure what this class under another professor would be like.\",\"If you have any interest in upper level mathematics, you should take this class. It will give you all the necessary tools you need to pursue anything else you would choose to in the department.\",\"If Dylan Wilson is teaching this class \u2013 take it. Best professor I've had in terms of actually prioritizing learning over completionism. The course material is still a little dry \u2013 it's proof\u2013based linear algebra, but Dylan makes up for it.\",\"Dylan is an AMAZING professor. I have never felt safe in a math classroom to inquire and genuinely learn until I took Dylan's class/had him as a professor. He really emphasizes learning to learn instead of for an output (grade). He is also great at explaining difficult concepts, and some things I didn't understand in 21b suddenly clicked in 121. Be wary of who is teaching this though\u2013\u2013experience is highly dependent on the instructor.\",\"This class has a ton of flexibility. If you can manage things on your own without outside structure, then take this class! Dylan is super nice and puts an emphasis on learning purely for learning's sake. If you're not great with a lot of flexibility and need external structure, don't take this. It's very self guided, so you won't be able to learn just with what's given.\",\"Take this class; it will definitely expand your understanding in general beyond math.\",\"It is probably not worth your time.\",\"Great class\"]"}}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I need to take a 130s level math class in the fall for my concentration requirements. first check if thats needed, then tell me all the fall options and what's easiest (by hours needed)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Math Concentration Requirements and Course Options\n\n## Concentration Requirements\n\nYes, as a Math concentrator, you do need to take courses at the 130-level or higher to fulfill your concentration requirements. Based on your profile, you've already taken MATH 121, which is a good foundation, but you'll need at least one course from the 130s series.\n\n## Fall 2025 Course Options (Ranked by Workload)\n\nLooking at the available 130-level courses for Fall 2025 and their workload data, here are your options ranked from least to most time-intensive:\n\n### 1. **MATH 136 - Differential Geometry** (EASIEST OPTION)\n- **Instructor:** Oliver Knill\n- **Workload:** 6.1 hours per week (significantly lighter than other options)\n- **Q Score:** 4.25/5.0 (well-rated)\n- **Content:** Introduction to Riemannian geometry focusing on curves and surfaces in space.\n- **Student feedback:** \"This class is a lot of fun and a good class to fulfill the 130s requirement.\" Students found it enjoyable and accessible.\n\n### 2. **MATH 131 - Topological Spaces and Fundamental Group**\n- **Instructor:** Michael Hopkins\n- **Workload:** 10.8 hours per week\n- **Q Score:** 4.56/5.0 (excellent rating)\n- **Content:** Abstract topological spaces, continuous functions, and an introduction to algebraic topology.\n- **Student feedback:** \"Auroux is a great lecturer,\" though some students noted the course gets harder in the second half.\n\n## Other Fall Options (Not in the 130s Series)\n\nIf you're open to courses outside the 130s that might still fulfill requirements:\n\n### **MATH 19A - Modeling and Differential Equations for the Life Sciences**\n- **Instructor:** John Cain\n- **Q Score:** 4.55/5.0\n- **Workload:** Not specified in the data\n- Note: This may not satisfy your 130s requirement\n\n### **MATH 18A - Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences**\n- **Instructor:** Roderic Guigo Corominas\n- **Q Score:** 4.43/5.0\n- **Workload:** Not specified in the data\n- Note: This may not satisfy your 130s requirement\n\n## Spring 2026 Options (For Future Reference)\n\nIf you can delay your 130s requirement to spring:\n- **MATH 130** (10.3 hours/week, Q Score: 2.00)\n- **MATH 132** (10.1 hours/week, Q Score: 4.18)\n- **MATH 137** (10.0 hours/week, Q Score: 4.28)\n\n## Recommendation\n\nBased purely on workload, **MATH 136 (Differential Geometry)** is clearly your best option for Fall 2025, requiring only 6.1 hours per week compared to 10.8 for MATH 131. It's also well-rated at 4.25/5.0, and student comments suggest it's an enjoyable way to fulfill the 130s requirement.\n\nIf you're willing to put in a bit more time for a highly-rated course, MATH 131 has the best Q Score (4.56) among your options but requires nearly 5 more hours per week.\n\nWould you like more specific details about any of these courses?"}]
